# This is __The Nerd Mage Module Programmer__  Project


The original intent of this project was to simplify pre-programming ESP modules.

I started out doing up a design to help a friend program ESP-M3 modules with OTA capable firmware that he could then solder into projects to be scattered around And never directly connected again.

And, of course, The rabbits showed up & started digging holes in my desktop...  As usual...
