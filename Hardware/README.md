# This is __The Nerd Mage Module Programmer__  Project

Each of the subfolders here is basically a KiCAD project.  Yes, I know there's a lot of duplication here.  One of these days, I'll figure out how to make KiCAD re-use existing schematics & board files as "libraries".

## The various "editions"...

- 0.5.2 (blank)
  - The base design with no module set up
- 0.5.2 (standalone)
  - A version with a pin header instead of a module
- 0.5.2 (ESP12)
  - Footprint added for an ESP-12 (or ESP-07)
- 0.5.2 (Wroom32)
  - Footprint added for an ESP-Wroom-32
- BOM.ods
  - Sort of a manually created Bill of Materials
