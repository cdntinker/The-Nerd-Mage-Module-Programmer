# This is __The Nerd Mage Module Programmer__  Project

Each of the subfolders here is basically a KiCAD project.  Yes, I know there's a lot of duplication here.  One of these days, I'll figure out how to make KiCAD re-use existing schematics & board files as "libraries".

- (KiCAD Customs)
  - Custom symbols, footprints, 3D models needed for this project
    - (Just the 3D models so far...)


## The various "editions"...

- (blank)
  - The base design with no module set up
- (standalone)
  - A version with a pin header instead of a module
- ESP-01F
  - Footprint added for an ESP-01F
- ESP-01S
  - Footprint added for an ESP-01S
- ESP-M3
  - Footprint added for an ESP-M3
- ESP-12
  - Footprint added for an ESP-12 (or ESP-07)
- ESP-Wroom-32
  - Footprint added for an ESP-Wroom-32
- Seeed Wio-RP2040
  - This one is VERY MUCH a WIP
  - Building & adding a footprint for the Seeed Studios Wio-RP2040 module
- BOM.ods
  - Sort of a manually created Bill of Materials

  ## To be done

  Need to work out how to add my custom symbols, footprints & 3D models in here...
